            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm an aspiring web developer at
              <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>.<br>
              First heard about <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>
              while reading an article on
              <a href="http://http://www.wired.com/2014/08/switch/">wired</a>.<br>
              At the time I was working as a database admin,
              after graduating as a software engineer,
              and I had lost track of the development world.
              When the opportunity presented itself I went for it
              only to find myself on the workbench of
              <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>.<br>
              <strong>And I couldn't be happier!</strong>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut">Beirut</a>,
              and raised in an open minded and supportive family who taught me to treat everyone with respect.<br>
              I spent most of my life in my home country <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon">Lebanon</a>.<br>
              I have traveled to Cyprus, Turkey, Georgia, Italy, Bahrain, France, Greece, Belgium, California, and New York so far.<br>
              A few years ago I started riding and <em>I fell in love with motorcycles and riding</em>.<br>
              Now my main goal is to become a freelance web developer, buy a bike and tour the world.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
            Where I come from people take education very seriously.<br>
            Then there's no wonder when I tell you that I went to one of the best private schools in Lebanon.
            After finishing school, I went to a private university where I majored in software engineering.
            and now after a while in the professional world (8 years) I decided it was time to
            go back to school and start a new career.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
              Brfore graduating I worked as a junior programmer in a company that created
              mobile and desktop application for warehouse management and salesforce
              for a couple of years.<br>
              After I graduated I worked for a year at a company specialized in
              banking web applications. At the time we were using XHTML, ajax and JSP
              to create our websites.<br>
              I only moved to the banking sector when I received a very generous offer
              from an 'A' bank in Lebanon. I worked there as a SQL database and reporting
              administrator for 6 years until I quit my job and joined this course.
